      <p>My hobby is singing.I like singing because it really calm downs my mind when there is so much homework or a lot of studies.I also like listening to music to get some ideas for making my own songs. I think singing is a way to express our thoughts and feelings.There are many kinds of music eg.Sad,exciting,slow,fast.It depends on you which you like I like fast and exciting music because it makes me do my homework faster!I strongly recommend to listen to music or sing a song at work it really helps!</p>
